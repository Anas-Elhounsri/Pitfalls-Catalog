| Identifier | Source | Pitfall | Description | Example | Importance |
|------------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|------------|
| P001 | codemeta.json | Versioning scheme do not match | Mismatch between CodeMeta metadata version (e.g., "version": "1.0") and actual software release version ("1.0.0") creates ambiguity and undermines version traceability. | https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/R3BRoot | High |
| P002 | LICENSE | Copyright section taken as template without modification | Unmodified license templates with placeholder values (e.g., <program>, <year>, <name>) reduce legal clarity and may invalidate the intended licensing. | https://github.com/cds-astro/aladin-lite | High |
| P003 | codemeta.json | SoftwareRequirements don’t have versions |Missing version constraints in softwareRequirements reduce reproducibility and may lead to compatibility issues across environments. | https://github.com/ctlearn-project/ctlearn | Medium |
| P004 | codemeta.json | version is different from the last release | A mismatched version field causes confusion and breaks alignment between metadata and the actual software release, affecting traceability and citation accuracy. | https://github.com/fairdataihub/FAIR-AMD-OCT-paper-code | High |
| P005 | codemeta.json | dateModified is outdated | An outdated dateModified misrepresents the current state of the software, reducing metadata reliability for users and indexing systems. |https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy | Low |
| P006 | package.json | There are more than two authors but only one section for them | Multiple authors are listed as a single string in package.json's author field, instead of a list | https://github.com/cds-astro/aladin-lite | Medium |
| P007 | codemeta.json | softwareVersion has Minor inconsistency | Minor inconsistencies in softwareVersion formatting (e.g., 0.10.2 vs v0.10.2) can disrupt automated version parsing and comparison by tools expecting a standard SemVer format. | https://github.com/ctlearn-project/ctlearn | Low |
| P008 | codemeta.json | README property pointing to their homepage/wiki instead of README file | Pointing the readme property in CodeMeta to a homepage or wiki instead of the actual README file reduces metadata precision and hinders automated tools from retrieving core documentation like usage, installation, and citation info. | https://rs-quality-checks-2b2333.gitlab.io/records/7633553/report_7633553/ | Low |
| P009 | codemeta.json | referencePublication refers to software archive instead of paper | Using referencePublication to point to a software archive (e.g., Zenodo DOI) instead of a scholarly paper misuses the field and limits its value for citation and academic context. | https://github.com/ctlearn-project/ctlearn | High |
| P010 | codemeta.json | License in codemeta pointing to a local file instead of stating the name. | Using a local file path (e.g., LICENSE.md) in the license field instead of a standard SPDX identifier or license URL reduces metadata interoperability and machine-readability. | https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/ | Medium |
| P011 | codemeta.json | softwareVersion is “master”, or “branchname” | - | https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/ | Low |
| P012 | codemeta.json | softwareRequirement pointing to url of a local file | Using a local file URL in softwareRequirements (e.g., file://...) breaks portability and prevents tools from resolving actual software dependencies. | https://github.com/cds-astro/mocpy | Low |
| P013 | codemeta.json | One license is listed while they have two | Listing only one license in codemeta.json when the software is dual ore more licenses, misrepresents the licensing terms and can mislead users or compliance tools | https://github.com/cds-astro/cds-moc-rust | Low |
| P014 | codemeta.json | programmingLanguages do not have versions | Not adding version information in programmingLanguage reduces reproducibility, as different versions of a language can break changes or face incompatibilities. | https://github.com/explore-platform/g-tomo | Medium |
| P016 | CITATION.cff | Does not have preferred publication even though it’s referenced in codemeta.json | Omitting the preferred publication in CITATION.cff despite its presence in codemeta.json hinders proper attribution and citation tools.| https://github.com/explore-platform/g-tomo | Low |
| P017 | DOI | Does not have DOI badge despite having an identifier in codemeta.json that is a DOI | Missing a DOI badge in the repository despite having a DOI in codemeta.json reduces visibility of the citation reference and may discourage proper software citation. | [NEED TO FIND THE EXAMPLE AGAIN] | Low |
| P018 | codemeta.json | Does not have identifier despite having DOI badge | Having a DOI badge in the repository but omitting the DOI from the identifier field in codemeta.json leads to incomplete metadata and hinders automated citation extraction. | https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/escape2020/wp3/zenodoci | Medium |
